Hi,

Thanks for using the Ubipy Music Player.

Here, I'll just explain how music should be added.

FOLDER STRUCTURE
=================

Music should be added following this folder structure:
|-music
  |-artist's name
    |-album name
      |-song
(in other words, there should be 1 folder in this folder (the music folder) for each artist, then WITHIN each artist's folder, their albums should be separated into separate folders. Each album's songs go into their respective folders. *DO NOT INCLUDE DASHES IN FOLDER NAMES.*)

For example:
|-music
    |-Bring Me The Horizon
        |-That's The Spirit
            |-Doomed.mp3
            |-Happy Song.mp3
            |-etc...
        |-Sempiternal
            |-Can You Feel My Heart.mp3
            |-etc...
    |-Get Scared
        |-Best Kind of Mess
            |-Drown.mp3
            |-etc...

FILE TYPES
===========

MP3 and Ogg Vorbis (ogg) files are currently supported, although mp3 should be audio only. It should also be noted that Ogg Vorbis files do not support any track length-based features including the display of the song's length, the representation of how far through the song you are, and the ability to skip through to another part of the song. As a result, these features are disabled during playback of an Ogg Vorbis file, and will be re-enabled on the next mp3 file.

Unsupported file types are skipped at index, and thus shouldn't break the player... No promises, though! (see license; warranty)

MP3 METADATA
=============

Currently, files should have the following metadata:
- TIT2 (in the Windows properties "details" section, this is called "Title")
- TALB (Windows details: Album)
- TPE1 (Windows details: Artist)

If the track name, album, or artist is not available via the file's metadata, then Ubipy will now resort to determine each respective piece of information via the song's file path.
